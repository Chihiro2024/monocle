MONOCLE
=======================

Monocle is an analysis toolkit for single-cell RNA-Seq experiments.  To use this package, you 
will need the R statistical computing environment (version 3.0 or later)
and several packages available through Bioconductor and CRAN.

This release supports Mac OS X and Linux. Windows may support this 
build, but Monocle has not been tested on Windows yet.
